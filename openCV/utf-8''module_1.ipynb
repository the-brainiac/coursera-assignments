    "Well, that's been a tour of our first external API, the Python Imaging Library, or pillow module. In this series of lectures you've learned how to read and write images, manipulat them with pillow, and explore the functionality of third party APIs using features of Python like dir(), help(), and getmro(). You've also been introduced to the console, and how python stores these libraries on the computer. While for this course all of the libraries are included for you in the Coursera system, and you won't need to install your own, it's good to get a the idea of how this work in case you wanted to set this up on your own.\n",

    "Finally, while you can explore PILLOW from within python, most good modules also put their documentation up online, and you can read more about PILLOW here: https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
